    description: 'KubeKit is a generic, application-agnostic Helm chart for deploying
      custom or in-house applications to a Kubernetes cluster. It is not tied to a
      single upstream application; instead the chart provides reusable templates,
      configuration patterns, and sensible defaults you can adapt to your own workloads.  Primary
      components provided by this chart:   - Deployment: runs your application pods
      with configurable image, replica     count, and resource requests/limits.   -
      Service: exposes the application inside the cluster; service type and     ports
      are configurable via `values.yaml`.   - Ingress (optional): exposes HTTP(S)
      routes externally when enabled.   - ConfigMap: stores configuration or templates
      consumed by pods.   - ServiceAccount: gives pods an identity; chart is ready
      for RBAC usage.   - HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA): optional autoscaling based
      on CPU/memory.   - Tests: includes a basic connectivity test under `templates/tests`.  Customization
      and usage notes:   - Edit `values.yaml` to configure image, tag, pull policy,
      probes,     resources, replica counts, service type, ingress hosts, and HPA
      settings.   - Override values at install/upgrade with `helm install --set` or
      a values     file for environment-specific changes.   - Ingress/TLS and HPA
      are optional; enable them when needed and provide     the required fields in
      `values.yaml`.  Versioning:   - Bump the `version` field in this Chart.yaml
      for chart/template changes.   - Update `appVersion` when the packaged application
      (if any) is upgraded.  See `values.yaml` and the `templates/` directory for
      full configuration options and examples of how to adapt the chart to your application.'
