description: |-
  KubeKit is a generic, application-agnostic Helm chart for deploying custom
  or in-house applications to a Kubernetes cluster. It is not tied to a single
  upstream application; instead the chart provides reusable templates,
  configuration patterns, and sensible defaults you can adapt to your own
  workloads.

  Primary components provided by this chart:
    - Deployment: runs your application pods with configurable image, replica
      count, resource requests/limits, and rollout strategy.
    - Service: exposes the application inside the cluster; service type and
      ports are configurable via `values.yaml`.
    - Ingress (optional): exposes HTTP(S) routes externally when enabled.
    - ConfigMap: stores configuration or templates consumed by pods.
    - ServiceAccount: gives pods an identity; chart is ready for RBAC usage.
    - HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA): optional autoscaling based on CPU/memory.
    - Tests: includes a basic connectivity test under `templates/tests`.

  Customization and usage notes:
    - Edit `values.yaml` to configure image, tag, pull policy, probes,
      resources, replica counts, service type, ingress hosts, HPA settings,
      and rollout strategy.
    - Override values at install/upgrade with `helm install --set` or a values
      file for environment-specific changes.
    - Ingress/TLS and HPA are optional; enable them when needed and provide
      the required fields in `values.yaml`.

  Versioning:
    - Bump the `version` field in this Chart.yaml for chart/template changes.
    - Update `appVersion` when the packaged application (if any) is upgraded.

  See `values.yaml` and the `templates/` directory for full configuration
  options and examples of how to adapt the chart to your application.

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: 1.2.0

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application. Versions are not expected to
# follow Semantic Versioning. They should reflect the version the application is using.
# It is recommended to use it with quotes.
